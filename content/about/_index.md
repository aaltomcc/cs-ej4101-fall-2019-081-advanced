# About me

My name is Alex Savia and I am currently studying towards my Bachelor of science degree in Aalto University. My major is Computer science and my minor is mathematics. At the time of writing this I am on schedule to graduate in the following spring. And in the following autumn my intensions are to continue my studies towards a master decree in Aalto University. My masterâ€™s major will probably be cybersecurity.

Computers have always been an interest of mine and this was one of the major reasons why I decided to start studying computer science, the other being a good employment situation in the field of computer science. And considering the future, the employment situation will not worsen.
